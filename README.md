"I hate signing up for websites. I’ve already signed up for so many, using different usernames, that going back to one of them and trying to remember my credentials is sometimes impossible. These days, most sites have begun offering alternative ways to sign up, by allowing you to use your Facebook, Twitter or even your Google account. Creating such an integration sometimes feels like a long and arduous task. But fear not, Omniauth is here to help.

Omniauth allows you to easily integrate more than sixty authentication providers, including Facebook, Google, Twitter and GitHub. In this tutorial, I’m going to explain how to integrate these authentication providers into your app."
